    A personal project. I built a web app to view my <span class="font-mono text-amber-600">myAir</span> data in a new way,
    hoping to see my data over a variety of timespans. At the same time, I wanted to learn more about the latest verson of
    Svelte, and decided to build an rudimentary app of some potential usefulness to me.

  <p>
    Feel free to use this for yourself. You'd just need to copy your own <span class="font-mono text-amber-600"
      >myAir</span
    >
    data, month by month, from the dev tools while you're logged in to your account, into the
    <span class="font-mono text-amber-900">data/monthlySleepRecords</span>
    folder, with filenames of the pattern
    <span class="font-mono text-amber-900">2025-01.json</span>. Each month is a network request called
    <span class="font-mono text-amber-900">graphql</span>, just copy its results from the dev tools to a file that you
    create.
